# [Velt Game Engine](https://velt.theodll.me)

 Velt is a 2D/3D Game Engine powered by Vulkan and inspired by Game Engines Like [Hazel](hazelengine.com), [Unity](uinty.com) and the [Source](vavtesoftware.com) Engine.

 Velt is going to have support for Vulkan and a good foundation for implementing other modern renderering APIs like Metal for native Mac Support and D3D12 for better Windows compatibillity. The ladder two will not be happening anytime soon.

 The first beta version of Velt is presumably going to release when following Features are implemented:
    - 2D Renderer
    - Audio System 
    - 2D Sprite Animation System 
    - Human Input
    - Runtime 
    - Somewhat functioning Editor

To compile Velt you're going to need following things:
    - CMake
    - A Modern C++ Compiler installed and functioning
    - The LunarG Vulkan SDK and included tools (Shader Compiler etc.)

Now simply run Setup.bat or Setup.sh and it will generate the project files for you
